Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? I think I was able to successfully complete the code, as well as research different aspects of what it would take to develop this application

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? I do not think that the design document helped my overall code, because the applciation was not finished. If we had worked on the full code, I think that the design document would have benefitted the application as a whole. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would likely redo the first assignment or the first third of the document. Since learning much more about the different facets of applications, I think I could answer the questions more throughoughly. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I focused on their objective throughout. When working for a client, it is important to incorporate their needs and wants as much as possible since you are working for them. They are outsourcing their work to you, so you must think of them as a boss. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? My first approach is to go with tested and workign methods. I try not to reinvent the wheel because I still consider myself a beginner.
